    abstract = {The high spectral redundancy of hyper/ultraspectral Earth-observation satellite imaging raises three challenges: (a)\&\#x00A0;to design accurate noise estimation methods, (b)\&\#x00A0;to denoise images with very high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and (c)\&\#x00A0;to secure unbiased denoising. We solve (a)\&\#x00A0;by a new noise estimation, (b)\&\#x00A0;by a novel Bayesian algorithm exploiting spectral redundancy and spectral clustering, and (c)\&\#x00A0;by accurate measurements of the interchannel correlation after denoising. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on two ultraspectral Earth imagers, IASI and IASI-NG, one flying and the other in project, and sketch the major resolution gain of future instruments entailed by such unbiased denoising.},
